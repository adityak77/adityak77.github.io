I am an Algorithm Developer at [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/), working at HRT AI Labs. I build automated trading strategies that scale to electronic markets around the world using deep learning.

Previously, I completed my Fifth-Year Master's in the [Computer Science Department](https://csd.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I worked with [Deepak Pathak](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpathak/) in the CMU [Robotics Institute](https://ri.cmu.edu/). My thesis was on using deep learning to teach robots to learn generalizable policies and perform diverse tasks.

Before that, I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Artificial Intelligence at CMU. While I was an undergrad, I was a teaching assistant for [15-451](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15451-f21/) (Algorithm Design and Analysis). I spent a summer interning at [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) as part of the OCR team, working on a model that processes text on images in over 60 languages.
